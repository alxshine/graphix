To compile just run make.

Our program has 2 modes you can switch in between using the '1' and '2' keys. it will start in Mode 1.

Mode 1:
In this mode the camera will rotate around the carousel.
The rotation can be paused and restarted by hitting the Space-key. When restarting the direction of the rotation will switch.

Mode 2:
Here the camera is fixed on the central point of the carousel but can be freely rotated using the 'w','a','s' and 'd' keys.
To Rotate around the z-Axis ( relative to the camera) use the 'q' and 'e' keys.

The program can be exited any time by pressing the 'c' key.
